/*
Protected -

The protected access modifier is similar to the private access modifier in the sense that
it canâ€™t be accessed outside of its class unless with the help of a friend class.

class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any subclass (derived class) of that class as well.

This access through inheritance can alter the access modifier of the elements of base class in derived class depending on the mode of Inheritance.
