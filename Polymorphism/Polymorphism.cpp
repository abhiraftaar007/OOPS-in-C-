/*
The word “polymorphism” means having many forms.
In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics.
A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations.
This is called polymorphism.

/* 
Types of Polymorphism - 
1. Compile-time Polymorphism -> Function overloading, Operator overloading
2. Runtime Polymorphism -> Function overriding, Virtual functions
